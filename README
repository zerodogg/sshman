sshman 0.1.1
README
----------

sshman is a simple ssh agent helper, along the lines of keychain.

Some of sshman's features:
- Persistant management of ssh agents
- Will only prompt for adding ssh keys to the agent one place at any one
  time
- Will not slow down logging into X, the ssh password prompt will be
  started in the background
- Will not try to start an agent if the user is logging in via ssh

To start using sshman, simply mkdir ~/.sshman as the user you wish to use
sshman as. To stop using sshman, simply rm -rf ~/.sshman as the user you
wish to stop using sshman as. If you don't want sshman to run ssh-add when you
log in through X11, but wait until you open a terminal, simply create the file
~/.sshman/requireTerminal - that will make it wait until you open a terminal
to prompt you for the ssh key passwords.
